                         ABSTRACT: Interpretation of scenes in image can be considered as 
                         associating semantic meaning to objects in the image. Usually, 
                         before the interpretation, it is necessary to segment the image. 
                         Segmentation partitions an image into regions (usually polygons), 
                         so the elements belonging to each region are similar with respect 
                         to one or more properties such as gray level, texture or color. 
                         However, segmentation may create several polygons and these 
                         polygons must be labeled, usually with semantically high 
                         information about it. Polygon labeling can be manual or automatic. 
                         Manual labeling needs a human expert to use his/her knowledge and 
                         experience. However, this task is, though not complex, 
                         time-consuming, repetitive and error prone. It is impractical for 
                         a single expert to analyze polygon by polygon and label them. 
                         Automatic labeling must incorporate human knowledge to be 
                         successful. However, automatic labeling may also to lead to errors 
                         since algorithms cannot reproduce faithfully the knowledge and 
                         experience that humans use. This thesis presents an alternative 
                         for manual labeling of polygons, based on citizen science, using 
                         several different human agents that may not have the same 
                         expertise as the expert to perform the labeling task. Citizen 
                         Science involves volunteers from the general public that act as 
                         participants or observers for data collection, classification or 
                         analysis. The volunteers' data may or may not be accurate; errors 
                         are expected. But, collectively, the volunteers' participation can 
                         generate knowledge and good results for scientific research. The 
                         experiment conducted with the volunteers in this work was based on 
                         labeling of more than 2400 polygons resulting from the 
                         segmentation of an image of urban scene. Several metrics have been 
                         derived from analyzing the data collected during the labeling 
                         process. This enabled the evaluation of the quality and 
                         reliability of their participation. These metrics demonstrated 
                         that citizen science is a feasible approach and it is a potential 
                         alternative to be considered for labeling polygons. The work also 
                         shows that this alternative aggregates values and complements the 
                         knowledge provided by a domain's expert. Examples of how these 
                         metrics may be employed by the expert are also

Galaxy Zoo opens
Press Release: 10 July 2007

Everyone can visit the ?Galaxy Zoo?

Caroline ZunckelAstronomers are inviting members of the public to help them make major new discoveries by taking part in a census of one million galaxies.

Visitors to www.galaxyzoo.org will get to see stunning images of galaxies, most of which have never been viewed by human eyes before. By sorting these images into ?spiral galaxies? (like our own Milky Way) or ?elliptical galaxies?, visitors will help astronomers to understand the structure of the universe. The new digital images were taken using the robotic Sloan Digital Sky Survey telescope in New Mexico.

?It?s not just for fun? said Kevin Schawinski of Astrophysics at Oxford University where the data will be analysed. ?The human brain is actually better than a computer at pattern recognition tasks like this. Whether you spend five minutes, fifteen minutes or five hours using the site your contribution will be invaluable.? Visitors will be able to print out posters of the galaxies they have explored and even compete to see who?s the best virtual astronomer.

M87The galaxyzoo.org team were inspired by projects such as Stardust@home, in which NASA invited the public to sort through dust grains obtained by a mission to Comet Wild-2. Oxford?s Dr Chris Lintott, co-presenter of the BBC?s Sky at Night programme and galaxyzoo.org team member, commented: ?What the Stardust team achieved was incredible, but our galaxies are much more interesting to look at than their dust grains. We hope that participants in Galaxy Zoo will not only contribute to science, but have a lot of fun along the way.?

Images for the project are taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which uses a 142-megapixel digital camera to create the largest digital map of the universe. ?It is great that digital archives we have built for science are now being used by the public to look at the universe? says Professor Bob Nichol from the University of Portsmouth. ?It will be great to have all the galaxies classified; it?s as fundamental as knowing if a human is male or female.?

The astronomers hope that the survey will shed light on how different kinds of galaxies are distributed across the sky. The results might even reveal that there is something fundamentally wrong with existing models of the universe.

Sir Patrick Moore, an enthusiastic supporter of the project, said: ?Non-professionals have always been deeply involved in studying the sky and they now have yet another opportunity to make themselves really useful. Moreover, their help is now of immense value so do join up ? as I am doing myself!?

@article{Silvertown2011,
abstract = {Organisms provide some of the most sensitive indicators of climate change and evolutionary responses are becoming apparent in species with short generation times. Large datasets on genetic polymorphism that can provide an historical benchmark against which to test for recent evolutionary responses are very rare, but an exception is found in the brown-lipped banded snail (Cepaea nemoralis). This species is sensitive to its thermal environment and exhibits several polymorphisms of shell colour and banding pattern affecting shell albedo in the majority of populations within its native range in Europe. We tested for evolutionary changes in shell albedo that might have been driven by the warming of the climate in Europe over the last half century by compiling an historical dataset for 6,515 native populations of C. nemoralis and comparing this with new data on nearly 3,000 populations. The new data were sampled mainly in 2009 through the Evolution MegaLab, a citizen science project that engaged thousands of volunteers in 15 countries throughout Europe in the biggest such exercise ever undertaken. A known geographic cline in the frequency of the colour phenotype with the highest albedo (yellow) was shown to have persisted and a difference in colour frequency between woodland and more open habitats was confirmed, but there was no general increase in the frequency of yellow shells. This may have been because snails adapted to a warming climate through behavioural thermoregulation. By contrast, we detected an unexpected decrease in the frequency of Unbanded shells and an increase in the Mid-banded morph. Neither of these evolutionary changes appears to be a direct response to climate change, indicating that the influence of other selective agents, possibly related to changing predation pressure and habitat change with effects on micro-climate.},

abstract = {People exert large amounts of problem-solving effort playing computer games. Simple image- and text-recognition tasks have been successfully 'crowd-sourced' through games, but it is not clear if more complex scientific problems can be solved with human-directed computing. Protein structure prediction is one such problem: locating the biologically relevant native conformation of a protein is a formidable computational challenge given the very large size of the search space. Here we describe Foldit, a multiplayer online game that engages non-scientists in solving hard prediction problems. Foldit players interact with protein structures using direct manipulation tools and user-friendly versions of algorithms from the Rosetta structure prediction methodology, while they compete and collaborate to optimize the computed energy. We show that top-ranked Foldit players excel at solving challenging structure refinement problems in which substantial backbone rearrangements are necessary to achieve the burial of hydrophobic residues. Players working collaboratively develop a rich assortment of new strategies and algorithms; unlike computational approaches, they explore not only the conformational space but also the space of possible search strategies. The integration of human visual problem-solving and strategy development capabilities with traditional computational algorithms through interactive multiplayer games is a powerful new approach to solving computationally-limited scientific problems.},

ABSTRACT: This work proposes an alternative to deal with the difficulties faced by urban planners in data collection oriented to urban mobility in small areas, on a spatial scale of neighborhood or district. The proposed solution, goes from (a) acquisition, based on new interfaces for mobile devices, conceptualized as mobile geogames, motivational games designed for the voluntary participation in the process of acquiring data of mobility, to (b) storage and processing, based on a server accessible to mobile devices through the game. The work presents the design of a computational architecture for implementing games with these features, which takes into account concepts of the volunteered geographic information, pervasive computing, gaming and data of tra-jectory. Lastly, a mobile geogame directed by this architecture, called URBANITAS, is developed, and a proof of concept is performed in predetermined areas in the city of S\{\~{a}\}o Jos\{\'{e}\} dos Campos/SP.},

abstract = {This paper examines the potential for collaborations between formal science professionals and loosely connected online groups that employ crowdsourcing within the information commons. It considers the differences between scientists and other online groups’ preferred modes of managing information production, circulation and application, distinguishing between ‘constituted’ and ‘adaptive’ authority and examining the extent to which these groups are engaged in curating the information they generate for the purposes of social problem solving. A small sample of crowdsourcing initiatives, drawn from the fields of astronomy and environmental science and crisis and emergency response, is examined based on desk research to illustrate the potential for boundary crossing between the domains of formal science and increasingly active loosely connected online groups which are engaged in activities giving rise to big data sets that may be ephemeral or may become constituted as ‘useful knowledge’. The conclusion suggests several measures that would strengthen the foundations for collaboration and indicates avenues for further empirical research.},

Sites such as Wikimapia and OpenStreetMap are empowering citizens to create a global patchwork of geographic information, while Google Earth and other virtual globes are encouraging volunteers to develop interesting applications using their own data. I review this phenomenon, and examine associated issues: what drives people to do this, how accurate are the results, will they threaten individual privacy, and how can they augment more conventional sources? I compare this new phenomenon to more traditional citizen science and the role of the amateur in geographic observation.},

abstract = {Every developer working with the Web needs to read this book. -- David Heinemeier Hansson, creator of the Rails framework RESTful Web Services finally provides a practical roadmap for constructing services that embrace the Web, instead of trying to route around it. -- Adam Trachtenberg, PHP author and EBay Web Services Evangelist You've built web sites that can be used by humans. But can you also build web sites that are usable by machines? That's where the future lies, and that's what RESTful Web Services shows you how to do. The World Wide Web is the most popular distributed application in history, and Web services and mashups have turned it into a powerful distributed computing platform. But today's web service technologies have lost sight of the simplicity that made the Web successful. They don't work like the Web, and they're missing out on its advantages. This book puts the Web back into web services. It shows how you can connect to the programmable web with the technologies you already use every day. The key is REST, the architectural style that drives the Web. This book:Emphasizes the power of basic Web technologies -- the HTTP application protocol, the URI naming standard, and the XML markup language Introduces the Resource-Oriented Architecture (ROA), a common-sense set of rules for designing RESTful web services Shows how a RESTful design is simpler, more versatile, and more scalable than a design based on Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) Includes real-world examples of RESTful web services, like Amazon's Simple Storage Service and the Atom Publishing Protocol Discusses web service clients for popular programming languages Shows how to implement RESTful services in three popular frameworks -- Ruby on Rails, Restlet (for Java), and Django (for Python) Focuses on practical issues: how to design and implement RESTful web services and clients  This is the first book that applies the REST design philosophy to real web services. It sets down the best practices you need to make your design a success, and the techniques you need to turn your design into working code. You can harness the power of the Web for programmable applications: you just have to work with the Web instead of against it. This book shows you how.},

Between 1990 and 1997, 5.8 +/- 1.4 million hectares of humid tropical forest were lost each year, with a further 2.3 +/- 0.7 million hectares of forest visibly degraded. These figures indicate that the global net rate of change in forest cover for the humid tropics is 23\% lower than the generally accepted rate. This result affects the calculation of carbon fluxes in the global budget and means that the terrestrial sink is smaller than previously inferred.},

abstract = {Humans have changed ecosystems more rapidly and extensively in the last 50 years than in any comparable period of human history. We have done this to meet the growing demands for food, fresh water, timber, fiber, and fuel. While changes to ecosystems have enhanced the well-being of billions of people, they have also caused a substantial and largely irreversible loss in diversity of life on Earth, and have strained the capacity of ecosystems to continue providing critical services.Among the findings: Approximately 60\% of the services that support life on Earth are being degraded or used unsustainably. The harmful consequences of this degradation could grow significantly worse in the next 50 years.Only four ecosystem services have been enhanced in the last 50 years: crops, livestock, aquaculture, and the sequestration of carbon.The capacity of ecosystems to neutralize pollutants, protect us from natural disasters, and control the outbreaks of pests and diseases is declining significantly.Terrestrial and freshwater systems are reaching the limits of their ability to absorb nitrogen.Harvesting of fish and other resources from coastal and marine systems is compromising their ability to deliver food in the future.Richly illustrated with maps and graphs, Current State and Trends presents an assessment of Earth's ability to provide twenty-four distinct services essential to human well-being. These include food, fiber, and other materials; the regulation of the climate and fresh water systems; underlying support systems such as nutrient cycling; and the fulfillment of cultural, spiritual, and aesthetic values. The volume pays particular attention to the current healthof key ecosystems, including inland waters, forests, oceans, croplands, and dryland systems, among others. It will be an indispensable reference for scientists, environmentalists, agency professionals, and students.},
